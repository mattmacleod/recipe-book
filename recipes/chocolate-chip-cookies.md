categories:
  - sweet bakes
servings: 16 cookies
prepTime: 15 minutes
cookTime: 10 minutes
equipment:
  - Baking sheet
  - Parchment paper
ingredients:
  - plain flour: 200g
  - baking powder: 1tsp
  - salt: 1tsp
  - brown sugar: 150g
  - caster sugar: 150g
  - softened butter: 200g
  - eggs: 2
  - vanilla extract: 1tsp
  - chocolate chips: 300g
steps:
  - Preheat the oven to 180℃.
  - Mix the flour, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl
  - Cream together the butter and sugar using a good processor or hand mixer, then add the vanilla essence and eggs and continue beating until fluffy
  - Add to the flour mixture and stir gently until combined into a smooth cookie dough
  - Add the chocolate chips and mix well until evenly distributed
  - Use a spoon to place small balls of cookie dough on a piece of parchment paper. You're looking for balls about 4cm in diameter, or about a quarter cup if you have a US measuring spoon. They'll spread a lot during baking – so make sure they're well-spaced and bake them in batches if required!
  - Place in the oven for about 8-9 minutes. They should be golden brown around the edges fading to just slightly brown in the middle.
  - Remove from the oven and place on a flat surface to cool off. When they've firmed up a bit, transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

This is a pretty standard soft cookie recipe that makes big American-style soft cookies. You can store the prepared dough in the fridge for a couple of days, or freeze it to use later.

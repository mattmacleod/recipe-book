name: Christmas Pudding
tags:
  - pudding
servings: 10
prepTime: 30 minutes (plus one week of soaking)
cookTime: 5 hours in advance, plus 3 hours before serving
equipment:
  - Large 1.7L pudding basin with a lid
  - Pan large enough to the pudding basin
  - Aluminium foil
ingredients:
  - dried fruit and nuts: 500 g
  - Soaking liquid (brandy, sherry, port etc.): 1 litre
  - plain flour: 500 g
  - fresh breadcrumbs: 125 g
  - suet (or vegetable equivalent): 125 g
  - dark brown muscovado sugar: 150 g
  - ground cinnamon: 1 tsp
  - ground cloves: 0.5 tsp
  - baking powder: 1 tsp
  - zest: 1 lemon
  - large eggs: 3
  - medium apple, grated: 1
steps:
  - First, soak the fruits and nuts. Place everything into a large bowl, cover with the liquid, and stir thoroughly. Cover and leave in a dark, cool place for about a week, topping up with liquid if needed.
  - After the fruit has soaked enough, it's time to cook the pudding. Start a pot of water boiling, large enough to hold the pudding basin you're using, and make sure the basin is throughly greased with a bit of butter.
  - Combine all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl, including the steeped fruit – making sure you get all of the liquid. Mix thoroughly, then press the mixture down into the prepared pudding basin. Wrap the top with a greased sheet of foil, then place the lid tighly on top.
  - Place the pudding in the pan and steam for 5 hours. The water should be about halfway up the side of the basin; make sure to check it frequently to avoid it boiling dry (I once ruined a pudding by not doing this, so be careful!).
  - After steaming, remove from the pan, set aside to cool, then remove the foil and store the basin out of the way until Christmas.
  - On the day itself, wrap the pudding in foil again and steam for another three hours.
  - To serve, remove fromt he pan, remove the lid and unwrap, then place a plate on top, turn the basin upside down and give it a little squeeze.
  - You can decorate this in different ways. I like to stick a bit of holly on top, or you can gently caramelise some half-slices of orange and arrange artfully around the base.

This is a pretty straightforward christmas pudding recipe that I think originated with Delia. I usually end up including a lot of nuts, which I think is actually pretty unusual for a traditional pudding – but after all, you can basically include anything you want.

I usually end up scaling the recipe up two of three times and making a whole bunch of puddings, because it's great to give them away to friends and collegues. Plus the recipe changes every year – that's part of the fun! You maybe want to start this recipe about 6 months before Christmas day to give the pudding time to mature and develop some complex flavours.

The dried fruits and nuts are usually a mixture of:

- Currants
- Sultanas
- Chopped prunes
- Cranberries
- Blueberries
- Mixed chopped peel
- Glacé cherries
- Blanched almonds
- Pecans
- Blanched hazelnuts

I usually soak it in something quite strong – over the years I've settled on a mixture of cheap brandy and Pedro Ximinez sherry. I also usually include a can of Irn-Bru and a glass of Buckfast, because I'm classy.

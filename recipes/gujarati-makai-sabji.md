prepTime: 10 minutes
cookTime: 30 minutes
ingredients:
  - corn cobs: 6
  - chickpea flour or gram flour: 60g
  - unsalted red-skin peanuts: 120g
  - vegetable oil: 5tbsp
  - full-fat yoghurt: 300ml
  - salt: 1tsp
  - ground turmeric: 2tsp
  - kashmiri chilli powder: 2tsp
  - sugar: 2tsp
  - chilli flakes: 2tsp
  - lemon: 1
steps:
  - Bring a large pan of water to the boil. Remove any husk from the corn, then split the cobs in half lengthwise. Add the corn to the water and boil for about 8 minutes or until tender. Drain and set aside.
  - Crush the peanuts to a fine powder in a food processor (or by hand, if you need to)
  - Heat the oil into a large frying pan until medium hot, then add the flour. Stir vigorously to smooth out any lumps and prevent it from burning. After 3-4 minutes it will turn a reddish-brown; when this happens, turn the heat to a minimum and stir in the peanuts. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
  - Add the yoghurt, salt, turmeric, chilli powder, sugar, and juice of the lemon to the pan. Mix to a thick paste, then slowly start adding 600ml of water, stirring continuously to form a smooth sauce.
  - Place the cooked corn in the pan, cover and leave to on a low heat for about 10 minutes. Transfer to individual bowls, and scatter with the chilli flakes and some extra lightly-crushed peanuts, if you like.

This corn-on-the-cob curry doesn't use tomatoes, onions or cream, but cooked nuts mean it has a lovely deep flavour.

name: Chicken katsu curry
categories:
  - chicken
servings: 2
prepTime: 1 hour
cookTime: 30 minutes
equipment:
  - A wide, deep pan suitable for deep frying
ingredients:
  For the chicken Katsu:
    - cornflour: 6tbsp
    - Panko breadcrumbs: 100g
    - egg: 1
    - salt: 1tsp
    - neutral oil for deep frying
    - chicken breast fillets: 2
  For the curry sauce:
    - onion: 1
    - Japanese curry sauce mix: 50g

steps:
  - Fill the pan with oil to a depth of about 4cm and place over a low heat to bring up to temperature. We want to fry at about 170℃.
  - Slice the onion, then place in a saucepan along with a splash of oil. Cook over a medium heat until soft and starting to brown – about 5 minutes.
  - Add about 400ml water to the onion and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes.
  - Meanwhile, prepare the chicken. Start by preparing a breading station – take three large flat bowls, place the cornflour in one, the egg in the next, and the Panko in the third. Mix the salt with the cornflour, then add a tablespoon of oil to the egg and beat.
  - Butterfly each breast and flatten it out. One at a time, dip each fillet in the cornflour, them remove and shake off the excess. Dip in the egg mixture until covered, then dip in the breadcrumbs, patting them in to ensure an even coat. Place on a plate.
  - When the oil is up to temperature, place one chicken breast into the plan, ensuring it's covered in oil. Fry for about two minutes on each side – the coating should be a nice, even golden brown. Repeat with the other breast.
  - Add the curry sauce mix to the onions and stir until combined. Simmer for 5 minutes until thickened.
  - Cut each fillet into slices, then serve with white rice and the curry sauce poured over.

This is a recipe for a straightforward chicken katsu curry. It uses a ready-made Japanese curry mix – something like S&B Golden Curry Sauce Mix. You can substitute a ready-to-use curry sauce if you prefer.

Canola/rapeseed, sunflower, or corn oil work for frying.

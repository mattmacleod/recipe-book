categories:
  - chicken
servings: 4
prepTime: 5 minutes
cookTime: 40 minutes
equipment:
  - Large saucepan
ingredients:
  - chicken thighs fillets: 1kg
  - escallion shallots: 3
  - garlic: 4 cloves
  - bay leaf: 1
  - salt: 1tsp
  - ground cumin: 1.5tsp
  - black pepper: 1tsp
  - olive oil: 1tbsp
steps:
  - Add the oil to the saucepan over a medium heat. Add the chicken thighs, trying to keep them in contact with the base of the pan as much as possible. Cook for a few minutes undisturbed, until starting to brown, then flip and repeat.
  - Peel and cut the shallots into quarters lengthwise, then throw them along with the rest of the ingredients into the pot. Add enough water to just cover the chicken.
  - Bring to a boil, then reduce and simmer until tender – about 30 minutes.
  - Remove the thighs to a bowl and shred with two forks. Continue cooking the stock until it's reduced by about half.
  - Spoon a couple of tablespoons of the stock over the chicken and toss to keep it moist.
  - Keep the chicken for up to three days in the fridge. Reserve the stock in the fridge as well - the fat will separate out and can be scraped off for use in other recipes.

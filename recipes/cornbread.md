A sweet cornbread recipe which is a good accompaniment to things like chilli or pulled pork. It can also be eaten with plenty of maple syrup and butter.

Jamie Oliver's Barbecoa restaurant used to serve a "Devil's Cornbread" dish that was similar to this, but with the addition of lots of melted cheese, herbs, and nduja. You can recreate this by adding about 200g of grated cheddar and mozzarella, some chopped parsley and a bit of nduja to the top of the cornbread immediately before putting it in the oven. Some chopped jalepeños also work well.

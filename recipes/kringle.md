prepTime: 90 minutes
cookTime: 20 minutes
ingredients:
  For the bread:
    - plain white flour: 280g
    - warm milk (40℃): 180ml
    - salt: 0.5tsp
    - sugar: 15g
    - active dry yeast: 7g
    - melted butter: 30g
    - egg yolk: 1
  For the filling:
    - softened butter: 50g
    - sugar: 75g
    - ground cinnamon: 3tsp
    - ground almonds: 3tsp
steps:
  - In a mixing bowl, combine the yeast with the sugar and milk, and stir until combined. Add the egg yolk and melted butter.
  - In another, large bowl, mix the flour and salt, then pour over the milk mixture. Mix together, then start kneading until it pulls together. Shape the dough into a ball, then place into a clean, oiled bowl to rest. Leave for 1 hour in a warm place, until roughly doubled in size.
  - While rising, mix the softened butter with the sugar and cinnamon, then set to one side.
  - Preheat the oven to 200℃. Line a large baking sheet with baking paper. On a floured surface, roll the dough to a rectangle about 45cm x 30cm.
  - Spread the cinnamon filling evenly over the top of the dough, reserving a tablespoon for later. Leave a 1-2cm area clear around the edges. Sprinkle over the ground almonds, then roll the doll into a spiral tube with the filling on the inside.
  - Slice the rolled dough in half lengthwise, leaving about 1-2cm uncut at one end so that the dough forms a "V" shape. Braid the two legs together, keeping the layers exposed to the top. Pinch the ends together and wrap underneath to form a wreath shape.
  - Transfer the bread to the prepared baking sheet. Brush with the remaining cinnamon filling, then bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown. For the last 10 minutes reduce the oven temperature to 180℃. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.

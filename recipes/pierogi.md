prepTime: about 45 minutes
cookTime: about 30 minutes
ingredients:
  For the dough:
    - plain flour: 350g
    - milk: 100ml
    - eggs: 2
    - salt: 7g
    - vegetable oil: 10ml
  For the filling:
    - potatoes: 1kg
    - butter: 20g
    - mature cheddar, grated: 100g
    - chopped chives: 1tbsp
  To serve:
    - sour cream
    - thinly-sliced onion
    - butter
steps:
  - Start by preparing the filling. Peel and chop the potatoes into 2cm cubes, then add to a pot of salted water. Bring to the boil and cook until they are tender – you should be able to break them apart with light pressure.
  - Drain the potatoes and spread out on a cutting board. Mash with a fork, then sprinkle over the grated cheese, butter, and chives. Mix until combined, being careful not to over-mix. Set aside.
  - Next prepare the dough. Add the flour to a large bowl, then mix the eggs and milk together until combined and pur on top. Add the oil and salt, then mix into a loose dough. Set aside for 10 minutes.
  - Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
  - Roll the dough out until it's quite thin - about 3–4mm. Cut a series of small circles (about 5cm diameter) using whatever you have to hand – a cookie cutter, small bowl, or anything else. When you're done, combine the scraps, roll them out again, and keep cutting until you've used up all of the dough.
  - Add a spoonful of the filling to each circle, then fold the dough over, flatten into a pierogi shape, and crimp the edges with a fork. Repeat until you've prepared all of the pierogis.
  - Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Drop in a couple of pierogis at a time and allow them to cook. They will float to the top – once they start to float, leave them to cook for two minutes then remove them to a slotted spoon. Repeat until they're all done.
  - You can refrigerate or freeze the pierogis at this stage. When ready to serve, place a large skillet over a medium heat with some butter and thinly-sliced onions. Cook for about 10 minutes until the onions and sticky and brown. Add the pierogis and turn occasionally until lightly browned, then serve with the onions and a generous dollop of sour cream.

Pierogis are a perfect comfort food. This recipe is for a basic pierogi dough stuffed with potato and cheese – first they are boiled, and then fried with some onions.

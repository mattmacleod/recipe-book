name: Japanese soufflé pancakes
categories:
  - sweet bakes
servings: 4
prepTime: 10 minutes (plus some chilling time beforehand)
cookTime: 10 minutes
equipment:
  - 4 large food rings about 8–10cm across
  - baking paper
  - large frying pan with lid
ingredients:
  - plain flour: 200g
  - eggs: 4
  - sugar: 4tbsp
  - vanilla paste: 0.5tsp
  - baking powder: 1.5tsp
  - buttermilk: 200ml
steps:
  - Before getting started, separate the egg yolks and whites and chill the whites in the fridge for at least an hour. We only need two of the egg yolks – you can retain the other two for another recipe.
  - Whisk together the remaining two egg yolks, sugar, vanilla extract and buttermilk.
  - Combine flour and baking powder, then sift into the wet ingredients while continuing to whisk until smooth. Set aside.
  - Place the egg whites into a bowl and the beat until they form stiff peaks
  - Carefully fold the beaten egg whites into the batter – take a quarter of the egg whites at a time and slowly fold into the batter. Don't over-mix! You're looking to create a smooth and foamy batter.
  - Prepare the cooking rings. Cut 4 strips of parchment paper so that they can be used to line the inside of the rings, then lightly oil/grease each one with butter and place inside. Make sure there isn't any extra paper hanging over the top – you'll need to flip the rings later.
  - Heat a frying pan large enough to contain the rings over a medium heat, and grease lightly with butter or a neutral oil. Place the lined rings into the pan.
  - Fill each ring about 2/3 full of batter, then cover the pan with the lid. Leave to cook for about 4 minutes, until the pancake has risen to the top of the ring. Keep an eye on the heat - better to cook too slowly than too quickly.
  - Carefully flip each ring over. The easiest way to do this is to get a spatula underneath and hold the ring with an oven glove, then perform the flip in one smooth movement. This will be messy if it goes wrong.
  - Cover and cook for another 4 minutes. Again, keep an eye on the pancakes – you want them to be cooked through, but not burned.
  - Remove the cooked pancakes from the frying pan and gently remove from the rings. Serve immediately.

We had these fluffy soufflé-style pancakes while visiting Japan. If you don't have buttermilk, you can substitute regular whole milk soured with a tablespoon of lemon juice.

My grandmother says that when she was younger, steak pie was the recipe used for any special occasion. New year's day, weddings, and so on. This is the recipe I use for a large steak pie that's suitable for up to eight people. It's got a layer of cheese under the crust – I don't remember where I picked that idea up from but it's great.

You can add a pastry crust as well as a lid if you're a pie purist.

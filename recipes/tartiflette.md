steps:
  - Preheat the oven to 170℃
  - Peel and slice the potatoes thinly using a mandoline, then drop into a large pan of salted boiling water for 3 minutes. Remove and spread out, allowing to steam dry.
  - Finely slice the onion into crescent shapes, and crush the garlic. Slice the cheese into long strips.
  - Place the pancetta or lardons into a cold frying pan and turn the heat on medium-high. Stir regularly until just starting to crisp up, then add the onions and butter. Cook for around 10 minutes until soft and golden. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes, then remove from the heat.
  - Arrange a layer of potatoes in the gratin dish, then spread some of the bacon and onion mixture over the top. Place some cheese slices on top, pour over some cream and wine, and season with salt and pepper. Repeat this in layers, using about a third at a time. On top, you should have a layer of potatoes covered with cream, wine, and cheese. Sprinkle with some additional salt.
  - Place in the oven and cook for about 90 minutes, until crisp and bubbling on top. Remove and leave to cool slightly before slicing and serving.

Basically a fancy potato gratin and a traditional après ski dish – serve it with a fresh green salad with a citrus dressing, pickles, and charcuterie. Reblochon is the most traditional cheese, but you can make it with whatever you can get.

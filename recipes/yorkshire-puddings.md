name: Yorkshire puddings
categories:
  - basics
servings: 12
prepTime: 5 minutes
cookTime: 20 minutes
equipment:
  - Large yorkshire pudding pan
ingredients:
  - plain flour: 140g
  - eggs: 4
  - milk: 200ml
  - vegetable oil for cooking

steps:
  - Preheat the oven to as high a temperature as you can - 230℃ or so.
  - Pour a little sunflower oil into each hole in a large yorkshire pudding tin – you're looking for it to be about 5mm deep depending on the size and depth of the tin. Pop it in the oven and allow it to heat up.
  - Meanwhile, prepare the batter. Beat the eggs into the flour then add the milk, continuing to beat until you've got a smooth batter. Pour into a jug.
  - Once the oil is up to temperature, remove the tin from the oven and pour the batter into the holes, distributing it evenly – remember, this recipe is for 12 puddings, so don't over-fill the holes!
  - Place immediate back into the oven and leave to cook for about 20 minutes until puffy and brown. Remove and serve immediately.

This recipe usually comes out perfect – just get the oven as hot as you can and don't open it – and make sure the oil is hot before you start cooking!

This recipe makes enough for 12 large puddings – so you'll need to work in batches or use multiple tins.

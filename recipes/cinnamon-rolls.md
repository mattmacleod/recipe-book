servings: 9
prepTime: 2 hours
cookTime: 20 minutes
equipment:
  - Square cake tin, around 25 ⨉ 25cm
ingredients:
  For the dough:
    - whole milk: 180ml
    - active dry yeast: 7g
    - golden caster sugar: 50g
    - egg: 1
    - egg yolk: 1
    - butter: 60g
    - bread flour: 450g
    - salt: 1tsp
  For the filling:
    - butter: 60g
    - soft brown sugar: 130g
    - powdered cinnamon: 1.5tbsp
  For the icing:
    - cream cheese: 100g
    - icing sugar: 100g
    - butter: 50g
    - vanilla paste: 0.5tsp

steps:
  - Start by making the dough. Warm the milk to around 40℃ and mix in the sugar. Sprinkle the yeast on top then stir and set aside for a couple of minutes.
  - Melt the butter. In a large bowl combine the egg and extra yolk, then add the yeast/milk mixture and the melted butter. Sir stir to combine, then add the flour and salt and bring together into a rough dough.
  - Knead the dough for about 8–10 minutes, either by hand or using an electric miser. It should form a nice soft smooth ball, which will be a bit sticky.
  - Transfer to a lightly oiled bowl, then cover with a towel. Leave in a warm place for 1 hour – 90 minutes, until doubled in size.
  - Soften the butter for the filling and combine with the cinnamon and sugar to make a spreadable paste.
  - Transfer to dough a floured surface and roll out into a large rectangle about 35 ⨉ 25cm. Spread the filling all over, leaving around 1cm around one short end of the dough rectangle.
  - Roll the dough up into a right log, along the shorter axis. Place seam-side down, then trim off then ends to form a nice regular cylinder.
  - Cut into 9 sections using a wire or serrated blade – you're aiming for clean cuts.
  - Line the cake pan with parchment paper and grease it with a bit of butter. Cover with cling film and allow to rise again for about half an hour.
  - Hear the oven to 180℃. Remove the cling film and bake for 20–25 minutes, until slightly golden brown around the edges. You're aiming to underbake them just a little bit, so that they stay soft in the middle.
  - Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for about 5–10 minutes. in the meantime, prepare the icing – cream together the ingredients until smooth anf fluffy, them spread over the rolls in the pan. Serve immediately – they'll keep for a couple of days ur up to a week in the fridge.

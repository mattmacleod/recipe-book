name: Seitan steak
categories:
  - veggie mains
servings: 4
prepTime: 45 minutes
cookTime: 45 minutes
equipment:
  - steamer basket
ingredients:
  - vital wheat gluten: 180g
  - cooked lentils: 200g
  - nutritional yeast: 25g
  - tomato puree: 2tbsp
  - soy sauce: 4tbsp
  - liquid smoke: 1tsp
  - garlic powder: 1tsp
  - chilli powder: 1tsp
  - ground black pepper: 0.5sp
  - olive oil: 2tbsp
  - maple syrup: 1tbsp
steps:
  - First, cook the lentils (if required) according to the instructions and allow to cool. Any variety of lentils are fine.
  - Add the gluten, lentils, yeast, tomato puree, liquid smoke and spices to a food processor along with 100ml of water and half of the soy sauce. Pulse until combined - if you don't have a food processor, you can do this by hand.
  - Turn the dough out onto your work surface and start kneading. It will start off quite dry and crumbly, but as you knead it, it will start to come together. After a few minutes, you will have a taut ball – stop at this point.
  - Split the dough into four equal chunks, then roll each out into rough steak shapes using a rolling pin. It will be quite tight and stretchy, so you might need to use a bit of force.
  - Add a bit of water to a pan that's suited to using with your steamer basket, then bring to the boil. Once boiling, place the steaks in the basket and cover. Steam for about 25–30 minutes, flipping halfway through and making sure the pan doesn't boil dry. The steaks should roughly double in size.
  - While steaming, combine the remaining soy sauce with the maple syrup, olive oil, and 60ml of water in a large bowl. Remove the steamed steaks and add to the bowl, turning to coat them all over. Leave them to marinade for an hour or so – or overnight.
  - When ready to cook, heat a frying pan or grill pan, and fry the steaks for a couple of minutes on each side. Slice and serve.

This is a recipe for making steak-like seitan patties from scratch. They're pretty tasty and I often use them as the base for something like tacos.

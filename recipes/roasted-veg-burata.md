ingredients:
  - Basil: 50g
  - Garlic: 4 cloves
  - Bread: 100g
  - Chillies: 2
  - Burrata: 2 x 150g
  - Olive oil: 2tbsp

  - Courgette: 1
  - Frozen peas: 300g

steps:
  - Preheat the oven to 220℃.
  - Wash the vegetables. Slice the leek and courgette into thin slices, then chunk the asparagus and pepper. Boil the peas for a couple of minutes and set aside.
  - Add the leek, courgette, and pepper to a roasting tray; add half of the olive oil and a pinch of salt, and toss to coat. Roast for 15 minutes.
  - Add the asparagus to the roasting tray and return to the oven for another 10 minutes.
  - Add the garlic, basil, juice of the lemon, and the rest of the olive oil to a good processor and blend to a smooth paste.
  - Remove the veg from the oven and transfer to a large bowl. Add the basil sauce and toss to coat.
  - Meanwhile, tear the bread into chunks, toss with a bit more olive oil, and pop in the oven for about 10 minutes until crisp. Whizz in the food processor along with the chilli and some salt, along with a bit of olive oil, until you have a fine crumb.
  - Assemble the dish – pile the veg on a plate, then top with the burrata. Slice a cross into the top so that it opens out like a flower, then sprinkle the chilli crumb on top. Add some sea salt and a drizzle of olive oil to serve.

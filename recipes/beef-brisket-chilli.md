prepTime: 1 hour
cookTime: 3 hours
equipment:
  - Large stock pot
ingredients:
  - beef brisket: 2kg
  - diced red onions: 2
  - sliced garlic: 12 cloves
  - chopped bell peppers: 4
  - finely sliced fresh red chillies: 4
  - plum tomatoes: 4 tins
  - beans (kidney, pinto, black…): 3 tins
  - olive oil: 50ml
  - large Ancho chillies: 5
  - ground cumin: 2 tsp
  - smoked paprika: 2 tsp
  - oregano: 2 tsp
  - bay leaves: 2
  - cinnamon sticks: 2
  - molasses: 3 tbsp
  - hot coffee: 500ml
  - cocoa powder: 1tbsp
  - lime, juiced: 1

steps:
  - Place the Ancho chillies in a bowl and pour over the coffee. Set aside.
  - Trim the brisket to remove all fat and skin. This is a pretty gnarly job and always takes longer than you think. Cut into 3cm cubes, against the grain.
  - Heat the olive oil in the pan over a low heat. Add the spices – cumin, paprika, oregano, bay leaves, and the onions. Cook until the onion has softened and just starting turning brown – about 10 minutes.
  - Slice the rehydrated chillies, and add to the onion mixture along with half of the fresh chillies, the garlic, cocoa powder, and some salt and pepper. Stir to combine.
  - Pour in the coffee, tinned tomatoes, and the molasses. Break the tomatoes up a little with a spoon, then add the brisket and cover. Leave for about three hours, simmering gently and stirring occasionally.
  - When the meat is cooked, it should basically be falling apart. Take two forks, and gently pull apart the chunks.
  - Add the bell peppers, then drain and add the beans. Stir to combine, then leave simmering uncovered for about 30 minutes.
  -  Add the lime juice, then have a taste and add additional seasoning as required. Serve with rice or tortillas, along with sour cream, guacamole, cheese, and all the usual fixins.

This is a from-scratch chilli made with pulled beef brisket rather than mince – the texture is wonderful. You can use a variety of different kinds of beans, but you should usually include at least some kidney beans. If you have any liquid smoke, a couple of teaspoons can add a nice smoky undertone.

name: Tablet
categories:
  - confectionery
servings: 30
prepTime: 25 minutes
cookTime: 30 minutes plus setting time
equipment:
  - 20 ⨉ 30 baking tin or dish
  - thermometer
ingredients:
  - white sugar: 900g
  - whole milk: 250g
  - unsalted butter: 110g
  - condensed milk: 397g
steps:
  - Heat the milk and butter in a very large pan until the butter has melted. It's important that this pan is absolutely massive – the tablet will expand in size as you cook it.
  - Add the sugar to the warm milk and stir continuously until dissolved.
  - Add the condensed milk and stir well. Increase the heat and bring the mixture to a boil. It's important to keep stirring continuously, or you risk burning the tablet on the bottom of the pan.
  - Cook until the mixture reaches soft-ball or 120℃, then remove from the heat and set aside for a few minutes to cool slightly. Meanwhile, line the baking pan with baking paper.
  - Start beating the tablet until it starts to thicken and set – it will look distinctly thick and grainy. This takes around 10 minutes.
  - Add a pinch of salt, or optionally some whisky, vanilla, or Baileys, then stir through. Pour the mixture into the pan.
  - After 30 minutes, score the surface into small squares – this will make it easier to break up later. Leave to set overnight, and then break up. Store in an airtight container.

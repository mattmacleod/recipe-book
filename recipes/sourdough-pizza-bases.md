servings: 4
prepTime: 1 day
cookTime: 15 minutes
ingredients:
  For the base:
    - sourdough starter: 200g
    - warm water (40℃): 450g
    - sea salt: 15g
    - strong white bread flour: 580g
  For the sauce:
    - tinned whole tomatoes: 400g
    - olive oil: 1tsp
    - dried oregano: 1tsp
    - sea salt: 1tsp
steps:
  - Combine starter, water, flour, and salt in a large bowl. Stir well until a rough, loose, sticky dough is formed.
  - Turn out onto a lightly floured surface, then knead thoroughly—adding a little more flour if needed—until a smooth and elastic ball of dough is formed. This should take about 10 minutes.
  - Store in the fridge, and leave to rise for at least 8 hours. The dough can be prepared up to 4 days in advance.
  - After the proof has completed, and 5 hours before baking, divide the dough into four equal portions and shape into tight balls. Place in a lightly oiled proofing container, like a high-walled baking dish, and leave on the counter.
  - When ready to bake, preheat the oven to the hottest you can make it. Make sure your topping ingredients are ready, then gently remove the proofed dough balls from the container and place on a lightly floured work surface.
  - Prepare the tomato sauce – drain the tomatoes and place into a blender, reserving the liquid for other recipes. Add the oil, salt, and oregano, and blend until smooth. Taste and season as required.
  - With each ball in turn, lay out a sheet of baking paper and lightly scatter with polenta. Gradually flattening out the ball into a pizza-sized disc, taking care to avoid pressing the air out of a crust at the rim – this is the bit you want to be puffy.
  - Add the toppings, and immediately place in the oven. Bake until cooked to your liking, then remove from the oven and serve.

These need to be baked at as high a temperature as possible! This recipe includes a basic tomato sauce to which you can add whatever toppings you want.

The sourdough starter is better the less well-fed it is.

  - Add the chestnut mushrooms to the pan and fry for about 10 minutes, until the mushrooms have dried out and are starting to turn golden brown.
  - Strain the porcini soaking liquid into a jug and add the vegetable stock. Chop the rehydrated porcini and set aside.
  - Stir the garlic and rice into the pan and fry for a couple of minuutes until it starts going transparent around the edges. Add the wine and allow to cook down for a minute, then start adding the stock mixture. Add a ladleful at a time, allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding the next.
  - When all the stock has been added, check the risotto and add an extra splash of hot water and cook for a couple of minutes if required â€“ the rice should be tender.
  - Add the zest and juice of the lemon, along with the chopped porcini. Chop the parsley and add as well. Cover, remove from the heat and set aside for 5 minutes.
  - Drain the pickled mushrooms and serve on top of the risotto.

Thi sis a vegan risotto recipe. It doesn't have quite the same creaminess as one loaded with cheese, but the pickled mushrooms are great.

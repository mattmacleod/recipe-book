prepTime: 30 minutes
cookTime: 30 minutes
equipment:
  - Large frying pan
ingredients:
  For the sauce:
    - soy sauce: 120ml
    - chicken stock: 120ml
    - dark brown sugar: 3tbsp
    - cornflour: 1 tbsp
    - cider or white wine vinegar: 2 tbsp
    - toasted sesame oil: 1 tsp
    - garlic, minced: 3 cloves
    - powdered ginger: 0.25 tsp
    - sesame seeds: 2 tsp
    - red chilli flakes: 2 tsp
  For the chicken:
    - boneless, skinless chicken thighs: 500g
    - cornflour: 3 tbsp
    - salt: 0.5 tsp
    - large egg: 1
    - black pepper to taste
steps:
  - First, prepare the sauce – just combine all of the ingredients thoroughly and set aside.
  - Prepare the batter – whisk together the cornflour, salt and egg, and season with pepper. Cut the chicken thighs into bite-sized pieces, drop into the batter, and mix well.
  - In the frying pan, heat about 1 tablespoon of oil. Place the chicken into the pan, piece by piece, making sure it makes good contact with the pan. Leave plenty of space for each piece – you will want to do this in two or three batches, adding more oil as required. Turn each piece a couple of times, until they are golden brown and cooked through.
  - When all of the chicken is cooked, add it all back to the pan, whisk the sauce to ensure it's still combined, and then pour it over the chicken.
  - Simmer on a gentle heat, stirring periodically, until the sauce has thickened. Remove from the heat and serve.

This is a Korean-style chicken recipe – the chicken is coated in a light batter and fried, then cooked in a sweet and sticky soy-based sauce. It's pretty sweet and salty, so not one for every day – but it's delicious.

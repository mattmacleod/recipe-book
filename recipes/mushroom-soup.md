name: Creamy Mushroom Soup
categories:
  - soups
servings: 6
prepTime: 15 minutes
cookTime: 1 hour
equipment:
  - Stick blender
ingredients:
  - dried Porcini mushrooms: 20g
  - mixed mushrooms (shiitake, oyster, chestnut etc.): 600g
  - garlic: 2 cloves
  - olive oil: 30ml
  - butter: 25g
  - small onion: 1
  - handful of fresh thyme leaves: 1
  - vegetable or chicken stock: 1 litre
  - double cream: 150ml
  - lemon: 1
steps:
  - Place the porcini mushrooms in a small bowl and cover with boiling water. Set to one side and leave to soak.
  - Wash the mushrooms and chop into bite-size chunks. Peel and finely chop the onion and garlic.
  - Heat a large pan with the olive oil and butter, then add the onion, garlic, and thyme leaves. Cook for about 5-7 minutes until the onion just starts to brown, then tip in the mushrooms.
  - Remove the porchini from the soaking water and add to the pan. Also add the water they were soaking in – pass it through a sive or a muslin first, as it may contain some grit from the mushrooms. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes or until the liquid has disappeared and the mushrooms are starting to brown.
  - Add the stock, then bring to the boil and reduce to a gentle simmer.
  - Use a stick blender to purée the soup just a little bit. Don't overdo it – you aren't going for mushy mushrooms here, and you still want plently of texture. Leave for 30 minutes, stirring ocassionally.
  - Add the double cream along with the zest and juice of the lemon. Stir to combine, then season to taste and serve – ideally with a swirl of cream and a sprinkle of thyme on top.

This is a wonderful, creamy mushroom soup that's perfect for autumn and winter. Use a mixture of whatever mushrooms you can find – basically, you can't go wrong, and more mushrooms means more flavour!

This recipe is vegetarian-friendly if using vegetable stock. Substitute the double cream for a plant-based alternative if you want to make it vegan-friendly too.

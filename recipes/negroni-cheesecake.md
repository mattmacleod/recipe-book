equipment:

  - Palette knife
ingredients:
  For the base:
    - melted butter: 100g
    - Loaker Napolitaner wafer biscuits: 180g
    - blanched hazelnuts: 50g
  For the filling:
    - cream cheese: 600g

    - oranges: 3
    - double cream: 200ml
    - gelatine leaves: 6
    - chilled negroni cocktail: 200ml
steps:
  - Preheat the oven to 160℃.
  - Lightly toast the hazelnuts in a dry pan until golden, then pulse in a food processor until roughly chopped. Add the biscuits and whizz until combined.
  - Pour in the butter and a pinch of salt. Combine, then spoon into the tin and press down firmly. Bake for 10 minutes.
  - Mix the cream cheese, sugar, and zest of two oranges in a large bowl. Whisk the cream to soft-peak in a separate bowl, then fold into the cream cheese. Spoon into the base and chill for 4 hours.
  - Once set, soak the gelatine in a small bowl of cold water for 5 minutes to soften it up. Warm 100ml of the negroni with a few large strips of zest from the remaining orange. When the gelatine has softened, squeeze out the excess water from each leaf and whisk into the warm negroni. Once dissolved, mix in the chilled negroni then pour over the cheesecake. Leave in the fridge for 2-3 hours.
  - To serve, run a knife round first then decant to a plate.

This is an amazing cheesecake recipe that looks great on the plate. I've also made it in the past using limoncello instead of negroni, and swapping out the oranges for lemons. I havent tried it, but I bet this would also be great as a gin and tonic cheesecake with limes instead.

Other bases work too – I've done 125g sugar + 250g oats for a gluten-free version in the past.

name: Roasted tomato pasta sauce
categories:
  - sauces and dips
servings: 2
prepTime: 5 minutes
cookTime: 45–60 minutes
equipment:
  - Large roasting tin
ingredients:
  - large tomatoes: 400g
  - large shallot: 1
  - garlic: 4 cloves
  - olive oil: 2tbsp
  - butter: 25g
steps:
  - Preheat the oven as hot as it will go – 220℃ or so
  - Slice the tomatoes in half (or smaller if they're absolutely massive) and place them cut-side down in a roasting tin. Add the olive oil and cover everything thoroughly.
  - Pop the roasting tin in the oven. The tomatoes will start to cook and release their juice – you want to cook them for about 30–45 minutes, until the juice is just starting to brown on the base of the tin.
  - While the tomatoes are cooking, dice the shallot and the garlic. Add to the roasting tin for about 4–5 minutes until just starting to brown.
  - Remove the roasting tin from the oven, and remove the tomato skins – they'll be burned and should just pop off the top of the tomatoes
  - Start combining the tomatoes, shallots, and garlic into a thick sauce. Deglaze the pan with the sauce – you can add a splash of wine of vinegar at this stage if you want.
  - Add the butter and allow it to melt, stirring to combine. This will result in a thick and glossy sauce.
  - Serve with pasta and a generous helping of parmesan.

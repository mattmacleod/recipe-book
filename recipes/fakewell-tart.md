name: Fakewell tart
categories:
  - sweet bakes
servings: 16
prepTime: 30 minutes
cookTime: 1 hour, plus time to cool
equipment:
  - Baking tray, around 25 ⨉ 35cm
  - Parchment paper
ingredients:
  For the crust:
    - pre-made shortcrust pastry: 500g
  For the filling:
    - fresh or frozen raspberries: 600g
    - fresh rosemary: 3 sprigs
    - icing sugar: 20g
  For the frangipane:
    - room temperature, unsalted butter: 200g
    - caster sugar: 200g
    - large eggs: 4
    - oranges: 2
    - lemons: 2
    - almond extract: 2tsp
    - ground almonds: 200g
    - plain flour: 40g
  For the topping:
    - icing sugar: 75g
    - limoncello: 25ml
    - flaked almonds: 30g
steps:
  - Preheat the oven to 180℃.
  - Pluck the leaves from the rosemary, then combine with the raspberries in a bowl. Sift over the icing sugar, then set to one side for 30 minutes.
  - In a clean bowl, start the frangipane by creaming together the butter and caster sugar. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then add the zest from the orange and lemon into the mixture, followed by the almond extract. Stir to combine.
  - Combine the ground almonds and plain flour, and gently fold in to the frangipane mixture. Set aside.
  - Lightly grease the baking tray with butter, then roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface until it's large enough to cover the baking tray – big enough to cover the bottom and slightly ascend the sides.
  - Place the pastry on the baking tray and pop in the oven for about 15 minutes. Remove, and lower the oven temperature to 140℃.
  - Spread the frangipane over the pastry, then drizzle the raspberry mixture unevenly across the top. Sprinkle over the flaked almonds, then bake in the oven for 30 minutes. Remove and allow to cool slightly.
  - Combine the remaining icing sugar and limoncello in a small bowl and mix until smooth. Drizzle over the cooled tart, then slice and serve.

This is an alternative take on a Bakewell tart that uses raspberries instead of cherries. It's best served by cutting it into small shard-shaped slices and making sure you get a bit of everything in each one!

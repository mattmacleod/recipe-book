servings: 2
prepTime: 20 minutes plus rising time
cookTime: 10 minutes
equipment:
  - 2 large baking trays
  - Baking paper
ingredients:
  - plain flour: 500g
  - dried yeast: 7g
  - salt: 1tsp
  - sugar: 1tsp
  - warm water (40 ℃): 375ml
  - sesame seeds: 2tsp
  - nigella seeds: 1tsp
  - egg yolk: 1
  - olive oil: 1tbsp

steps:
  - Combine the flour, yeast, sugar and salt in a bowl, then add the water. Stir until it comes together into a wet dough.
  - Turn out the dough on on to a floured surface. Knead for about 15 minutes, until smooth.
  - Place the dough in a clean, oiled bowl. Cover with a damp towel, then set aside in a warm place for 60–90 minutes until roughly doubled in size.
  - Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and cut in half. Flatten each half out slightly, then place onto two separate pieces of floured baking paper – each large enough to cover the baking trays. Cover with a damp towel and leave for about 15 minutes.
  - Preheat oven to about 230℃, then stretch each piece of dough out until it's roughly the size of the baking sheet. Take care to leave a little bit of volume around the edges – this will help it to form a nice light texture in the oven. Leave on the baking paper, cover with the damp towel again and set aside for 15 minutes.
  - Combine the egg yolk and oil in a small bowl, then brush all over both flatbreads. Use your fingers to make some small indentations all over each of them – then combine the nigella and sesame seeds and sprinkle evenly on top.
  - Place each flatbread on a baking tray and into the oven. Cook for about 8–10 minutes, until cooked and golden brown. Remove to a wire rack and allow to cook for a few minutes, before slicing into rough rectangles.

This is a Turkish bread that's great for making things like a yogurtlu kebab – or just as a general BBQ side.

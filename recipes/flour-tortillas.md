name: Flour tortillas
categories:
  - basics
servings: 24
prepTime: 15 minutes
cookTime: 45 minutes
equipment:
  - large skillet
  - tortilla press (optional)
ingredients:
  - plain flour: 500g
  - baking powder: 2tsp
  - salt: 1tsp
  - coconut oil: 4tsp
  - water: 250ml
steps:
  - Combine the flour, salt and baking powder in a mixing bowl. Add the coconut oil and combine using your fingers until the mixture resembled fine breadcrumbs. At the point, it should kind of stick together and hold its form when pressed. Add the water and mix until the dough pulls together into a cohesive ball.
  - Place the dough on a lightly floured work surface and knead for a few minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Divide into 24 equal pieces and roll each into a ball. Leave to sit for around 10 minutes for the gluten to develop.
  - Use a well-floured rolling pin and a well-floured surface to flatten each tortilla into a flat, round disk. It needs to be pretty thin â€“ maybe the thickness of a 2p coin.
  - Place a large skillet over a medium-high heat and place each tortilla in turn on the skillet, cooking until bubbly and golden. Flip and continue cooking until golden on both sides. For extra taste and texture, fire each tortilla briefly over a naked flame.

This is an unconventional flour tortilla recipe that that uses coconut oil instead of lard, and it actually works pretty well.

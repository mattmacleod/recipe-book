# Matt's recipe book

This is a small web application for storing and publishing recipes I use. It contains a variety of different recipes that I've been making over the years, and they come from lots of different sources.

I built this site to keep track of all the things I've made, so that I can remind myself how to cook them in the future and share them with others.

This site is inspired by [chowdown.io](https://chowdown.io), which is a similar project using a different implementation and backend.

The content on this site is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). This means that you can use it for any purpose, so long as you give attribution. Please link back to this site if you do use these recipes elsewhere. The code itself is under an [MIT license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattmacleod/recipe-book/main/LICENSE.txt).

You can view the source code of this site—including all of the recipes—on GitHub. Please feel free to raise a PR if you want to add a recipe to fix anything!

From a technical perspective, this site is built using Next.js, which is a framework for building modern web applications. Recipes are stored in plain-text Markdown format and rendered to a static HTML page. You can compare the [Markdown recipe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattmacleod/recipe-book/main/recipes/negroni-cheesecake.md) with the [rendered content](https://recipes.matt-m.co.uk/recipes/negroni-cheesecake) to see how this works.

I plan to add some more useful features to this site as I get the chance, such as automatic unit conversions, quantity scaling, and so on – but for the moment I just wanted to build a place to let me store and share recipes. So please enjoy!
